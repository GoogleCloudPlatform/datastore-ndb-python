"""A task decorator.

This should wrap a generator, e.g.:

  @task
  def foo():
    yield <some future>
    yield <another future>
    raise StopIteration(42)

Now calling foo() is equivalent to scheduler.schedule(foo()), and returns
a future that will produce 42 once foo() completes.

As a special feature, if foo() is not a generator, it will be run till
completion and the return value returned via a future.  This is to make
the following two equivalent:

  @task
  def foo():
    return 42

  @task
  def foo():
    if False: yield
    raise StopIteration(42)  # Or, after PEP 380, return 42

(This idea taken from Monocle.)

(How does Monocle do the trampoline?  Does it use the Twisted reactor?)
