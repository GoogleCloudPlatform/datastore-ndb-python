Release 0.9.3

Two bugfixes:

- Fixes issue 94 (tracebacks when memcache returns network errors).
- Fixes issue 92 (logging too verbose).

----------------------------------------

Release 0.9.2

This release contains several bugfixes and minor improvements:

- Reject queries for unindexed properties.
- Fix issue 91: with use_datastore=False, .put() would not overwrite
  an existing value in memcache.
- Fix issue 19: more robust get_or_insert() signature.
- Fix issue 87: bug in whole-structure property queries.
- Fix repr() of AND node to actually say AND(...).  (It said OR(...)!)
- Support whole-structure matching for nested structures.
- The repr() of a model class now shows the list of properties.
- Fix the repr() of an Expando read back from the datastore.
- Optimization: when reading an entity, don't read the key twice.
- Add some new tests; test-related Makefile changes.
- Various minor cleanups and refactorings, typo fixes, etc.
- Fix ndb.__version__.

----------------------------------------

Release 0.9.1

This release contains two bugfixes for release 0.9:

- issue 83: ComputedProperty inside repeated StructuredProperty blows up
- issue 85: Python 2.7 runtime raises incorrect "RuntimeError: Result cannot be set twice"

----------------------------------------

Release 0.9

NOTE: When switching from 0.8 (or back), you must clear memcache!

Most important changes since 0.8:

- Improved consistency in memcache integration
- Improved behavior of auto-batching through idle callbacks
- Reduced size of entities written by memcache integration

Bugs fixed:
- Issue 73: use namespace from key for caching
- Issue 77: support querying for prop==None, prop!=None
- Issue 76: fix corner case in repr(entity)
- Issue 78: preserve namespace in .filter() and .order()
- Issue 81: make Context.flush() more effective
- Issue 75: optional validation for model keys
- Fixed IN operator for KeyProperty, None and more

Other changes:
- A ComputedProperty can now be marked repeated=True;
  the function must return a list in this case
- Replaced asserts with better exceptions
- General code cleanup
- Added ndb.__version__ variable (set to '0.9')
- Improved test runners etc.
