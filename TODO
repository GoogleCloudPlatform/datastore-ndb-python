Go public.

Finalize Query API.  Add Model.all().  Decide what to call
Query.looper().  Add Query.map().

Make Model().get()/put()/delete() async.  Add get_or_insert().

Prettify MultiQuery API (add_dependent() vs. putq() and getq()).

Handle exceptions in callbacks uniformly.

Ensure that Models are pickled as pbs, so caching doesn't have
to do anything special.
