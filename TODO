Go more public.

Fix up code: style, docstrings, TODOs.  Increase coverage again.

Separate tutorial, user guide, reference manual.  Explain the things
that Brett & Nick asked in feedback.

Add Query methods going through default context for map and iter (and
possibly a fetch()).

Make Model().get()/put()/delete() async and go through default
context.  Add Model.get_or_insert().

Add a public API for QueryOptions.

Handle exceptions in callbacks uniformly.

Ensure that Models are pickled as pbs, so caching doesn't have
to do anything special.
