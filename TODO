Make default context management part of regular tasklets + Futures.

Add Query methods going through default context for map(callback),
map_async(callback), fetch(limit), fetch_async(limit), count(limit),
count_async(limit).

Go more public.

Fix up code: style, docstrings, TODOs.  Increase coverage again.

Separate tutorial, user guide, reference manual.

Add a public API for QueryOptions.

Handle exceptions in callbacks uniformly.

Ensure that Models are pickled as pbs, so caching doesn't have
to do anything special.
